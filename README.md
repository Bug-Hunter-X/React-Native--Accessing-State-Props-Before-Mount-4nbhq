This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native development: accessing component state or props before the component has fully mounted. The `Bug.js` file shows the erroneous code, resulting in undefined state/props. `BugSolution.js` presents the corrected implementation. The error typically manifests as an undefined value error when trying to access state/props before the component's `componentDidMount` lifecycle method is executed.  Asynchronous operations initiated in the component's constructor or other early lifecycle methods can exacerbate the issue.  Ensure that any access to state or props occurs *after* the component is mounted to prevent errors.
