To resolve this, access state and props within lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount` that are guaranteed to execute after the component is mounted.  For asynchronous operations that need to update the state, use `setState` within `componentDidMount` or handle the asynchronous operation's completion before attempting state access. If you need to set default state, do so within the constructor or the state object literal.
